# Git Ript

This app allows users to record and track different workouts.

## Description

The app gives users the ability to create a profile. Profile page shows past workouts and graphs workout totals by type of Workout. Users can search for pre-loaded workouts by type or body part. Users also have the ability to enter custom workouts. Pre-loaded workouts include a picture and link to a video demo. Cardio activities calculate calories based on distance and weight.

## Motivation

Our group wanted to create an easy to use workout app to track out workouts. We want the app to be social with the ability to find friends and challenge other users to specific workouts.
